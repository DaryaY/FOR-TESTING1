        <h3>iKeyDigital is a name that my father, Igor Yasev, would like to use to become an independent computer engineer and a programmer. He asked me to create a finished website template for his future business. I decided to keep the same color scheme as my portfolio (surprise!) as we plan on working together as a family business. The design integrates a Russian version of the same website, a very easy-to-sue toolbar with hoverable icons that represent each section (as well as what section you’re located at), and a comfortable layout. Along with that, the website is responsive and flexible to different screen sizes, which makes it adaptable to devices with small screens like an iPhone as well as wide screens.</h3>

        <h3>A fellow university student asked me to help design a logo for his mother’s – Maria Pineda’s – trade, which involves treating lice without using chemicals. I was given a deadline: a week to design the logo. The client specifically wanted a logo that would have: a green color, and a leaf (optional, but I included it). The green color and the leaves convey the eco-friendly methods used to treat lice, sticking to natural means of treating it. Hence, I decided to integrate the leaves for a clearer message as well as to include the “Lice Treatment Plus“ text, except integrate the “Plus” as the symbol that underlines the base on which the text is located while the leaves are fanning out.</h3>
        <h3>To give an appealing look to the logo, I was playing around with possible color combinations (including the usage of the gradients), and since I was communicating through the student in regards to the logo iterations, I was asked to deliver all color variations that were made in the end. I have finished the logo samples two days prior the deadline.</h3>

      <h3>A YouTuber named The Lucky Gambit asked me to design a logo, a watermark, and an end video template. For a watermark, the client specifically asked to design a symbol that would be used as a trademark for the channel, and to somehow integrate that symbol in the logo. The inspiration I received were ancient coins and the fact that in some countries, coins symbolize luck. Then I decided to search some examples of the more creative coins, and have found the Celtic patterns, which I decided to integrate it in the making of the watermark – a golden coin. The final version, however, does not have an exact Celtic pattern; some elements of it were modified to suit the design.</h3>

      <h3>Next, the client asked me to represent her on the logo but as a cartoon character. The version we ended up creating was her cartoon version sipping tea from a teacup, which had the watermark on it. Since the client wanted to create videos involving games and have her face recorded, her cartoon self has headphones. All YouTubers who have their faces recorded while playing video games have headphones on due to the limitations with recording: they must be able to hear the game footage but not record an “echo” from the speakers, hence the headphones. It is such a key feature that I simply had to have on the logo. And the teacup? To display her love for these drinks, a part of her identity as an individual.</h3>

      <h3>Last, the YouTuber asked to make an “End Video” template, which is either a video or an image placed at the end of the video. Its purpose? To allow the viewer to click on features that are place there by the YouTuber, such as the channel subscription button, suggested videos, links, and others. The current version has falling coins in an abstracted background. The coin in the middle would be clickable, which will lead the viewer to the channel page or the subscribe button. The other two frames are for displaying other video thumbnails (the brown background will not be displayed – it is simply a placeholder).</h3>

I decided to go for a casual, warm mood that is often found in old brick bars with neon lights. The same principle was applied to the watermark, which is present in the banner.</h3>
